	<p class="aboutus"> On July 15, 2006 I married a wonderful women that happened to be originally from Hungary.Both of us came from a family that was very
	much into cooking and making home cooked meals for family gatherings. Now that my wife and I are married we have been making many dishes
	that express the richness and flavors of our two cultures. What you will find here are some of our favorite American and Hungarian dishes.</p>
